Forest fires are a serious environmental problem that can cause damage to ecosystems, wildlife, and human lives. To prevent and mitigate the impact of forest fires, it is important to be able to predict the occurrence and spread of fire based on various factors. In this project, we use machine learning to develop a forest fire prediction model based on three features: temperature, humidity, and oxygen percentage. We use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is a simple and effective method for classification and regression problems. SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable.
